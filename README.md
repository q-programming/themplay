Application to play songs in playlists
--------------------------------------

Main goal is to create multiple playlists ( grouped within presets) and allow to quickly switch between them by single tap

When playlist is tapped, app will save current song position and fade into new song ( fade time can be configured )

Let's imagine you want to organize D&D roleplay session. You can configure couple playlists like "tavern", "dungeons" , "woods" "battle" etc. etc.

Add songs based on theme to each of those playlist, and start your session

Your party ventures into woods? You have playlist for this!

They were ambushed by some orcs and battle is starting, switch to "battle" and in matters of seconds , your theme music changes.

Once enemy is slain , just tap back to woods playlist and continue with your quest just where you finished...
