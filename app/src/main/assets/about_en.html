<h2 class="text-centered">Application to play songs in playlists</h2>
<p>
    Main goal is to create multiple playlists ( grouped within presets) and allow to quickly switch
    between them by single tap</p>
<p>
    When playlist is tapped, app will save current song position and fade into new song ( fade time
    can be
    configured )
</p>
<p>Let's imagine you want to organize D&D roleplay session. You can configure couple playlists like
    "tavern", "dungeons" , "woods" "battle" etc. etc. </p>
<p>Add songs based on theme to each of those playlist, and start your session</p>
<p> Your party ventures into woods? You have playlist for this!</p>
<p>They were ambushed by some orcs and battle is
    starting, switch to "battle" and in matters of seconds , your theme music changes.</p>
<p>Once enemy is slain , just tap back to woods playlist and continue with your quest just where you
    finished...</p>
<h2>How to use?</h2>
<h4>Presets</h4>
<p>After first launch there is nothing there. You have to start by creating a preset.<br>It will be
    one of many collections of playlists, grouped together for various occasions. Thanks to this ,
    you can have
    some peaceful collection for board games with family , and another with some heavy metal for
    rpg session
    with your friends ( or other way around ...) </p>
<p>Once you create and make preset active , new playlist is created will be assigned to it</p>
<p>To switch to new preset , either click your current preset name at the top of application , or
    choose "presets" from application menu at the bottom</p>
<p>it's possible to save preset contents in form of text file. Choose download icon next to trash
    can of preset, choose file name ( preset name by default ). All playlists and songs inside will
    be writen in form of list in that file</p>
<h3>Playlists</h3>
<p>Main application functionality, holding list of songs, and ensuring only one is active at the
    time</p>
<h4>Creating playlist</h4>
<p>To create new playlist , make sure proper preset is activated and select "Add new playlist" from
    application at bottom of screen
    <br>
    You will be asked to give name to playlist, and then be moved to edition screen</p>
<p>On it you can add new songs by clicking "Add new song" button. After that action new window will
    be open with default android file selection. Choose songs which should be added to playlist and
    confirm your selection</p>
<p>To remove song , press and hold it for a bit , which will activate multiple selection. Select all
    songs that you would like to remove and confirm with pressing "Remove selected songs"</p>
<p> Press back button on your phone , or tap back arrow at the top of the screen</p>
<h4>Editing playlists</h4>
<p>To edit existing playlist choose "Edit playlist" from context menu available under three dots on
    playlist card</p>
<p>Edition screen is identical to creation screen and works exactly the same</p>
<h4>Changing playlist card look</h4>
<p>It's possible to change unique look of each playlist separately. To change look, select "Change
    playlist look" from context menu available under three dots on playlist card</p>
<p>On this screen you can pick and crop photo or picture from your gallery , by clicking "Change
    background" button </p>
<p>If you would like to remove existing background and restore default playlist card look, select
    "Remove background" button</p>
<p>To adjust text visible on picture, select one of available colors by clicking "change text color"
    button.
    You can additionally add shadow outline to improve it's readability ( true by default ) </p>
<h4>Removing playlists</h4>
<p>To remove playlist, select "Delete playlist" from context menu available under three dots on
    playlist card<br>
    <b>Please note that this operation cannot be undone!</b>.
</p>
<p>
    No physical files will be removed during that operation</p>
<h4>Coping playlist</h4>
<p>It's possible to duplicate your previously created list in order to make more of similar ones, or
    have exact copy within other preset</p>
<p>To copy playlist , select "Copy playlist" from playlist context menu. This will show a toast
    message with information that playlist is now in application clipboard. Now select other preset
    , or stay in current and then select "Paste playlist" from bottom application menu</p>
<p>This operation will create exact copy of playlist , including all songs information, background,
    text color etc. Only current song and, if playlist is currently active is not
    carried over. Once this operation is done, app clipboard will be cleared and paste option won't
    be available until next playlist is copied</p>
<p>Please note that once playlist is copied and pasted it's not linked to original playlist. New
    playlist is just a duplicate and changing any of them is not affecting other</p>
<h4>Changing order of playlist</h4>
<p>It's possible to change order of playlist within preset.<br>To do so long press on playlist and
    then drag and drop it to new place. New order will be saved right away. Any new added or pasted
    playlist is always added at the last position </p>
<h3>Playback</h3>
<p>To start playing your playlist , all you need to do is to either click it and activate it , or
    press play button if it's already active. Play button is available at the bottom of the screen
    together with other multimedia buttons</p>
<p>If for some reason application cannot play one of songs ( bad format or file was moved/deleted )
    application will show notification , remove song from that playlist and attempt to play next
    song from playlist</p>
<h4>Shuffle playlist</h4>
<p>By default application will try to play songs in random order from selected playlist. It will be
    done by temporally creating random list of all songs from playlist and going through it one by
    one. When list will play last song, new one will be randomly created and current song will be on
    last position</p>
<p>Random order is generated every time playlist is activated, which means that if we switch
    playlists often , and playlist is not big enough , some songs might play more often </p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
Application has some basic settings
<h4>Dark mode</h4>
<p>How application should be displayed, light mode by default</p>
<h4>Fade between songs duration </h4>
<p>How long ( in seconds ) should the transition be when moving from one song to another, or when
    activating second playlist
</p>
<h4>Don't turn off screen</h4>
<p>When selected , application will prevent from turning off screen as long as it's active</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If something goes wrong and application crashes, please create issue on github</p>
<p>In settings , tap version number 5 times to enable developer mode. Then you can enable debug log. This will store some debug information on user interaction on application </p>
<p>Whenever application crashes, logs files are generated. Please include those to issue</p>
