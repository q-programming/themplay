<h2 class="text-centered">Application to play songs in playlists</h2>
<p>
    The main goal is to create multiple playlists (grouped within presets) and allow quick switching
    between them with a single tap.</p>
<p>
    When a playlist is tapped, the app will save the current song position and fade into the new song (fade time
    can be configured).
</p>
<p>Let's imagine you want to organize a D&D roleplay session. You can configure several playlists like
    "tavern", "dungeons", "woods", "battle", etc.</p>
<p>Add songs based on the theme of each playlist and start your session.</p>
<p>Your party ventures into the woods? You have a playlist for this!</p>
<p>They were ambushed by some orcs and a battle is
    starting? Switch to "battle" and in a matter of seconds, your theme music changes.</p>
<p>Once the enemy is slain, just tap back to the woods playlist and continue with your quest right where you
    left off...</p>
<h2>How to use?</h2>
<h3>Presets</h3>
<p>After the first launch, there is nothing there. You have to start by creating a preset.<br>It will be
    one of many collections of playlists, grouped together for various occasions. Thanks to this, you can have
    a peaceful collection for board games with family, and another with heavy metal for an
    RPG session with your friends (or the other way around...).</p>
<p>Once you create and make a preset active, any new playlist created will be assigned to it.</p>
<p>To switch to a new preset, either click your current preset name at the top of the application, or
    choose "presets" from the application menu at the bottom.</p>
<p>It's possible to save preset contents in the form of a zip file together with all your music files.
    Choose the download icon next to the trash can of the preset, choose a file name (preset name by default).
    All playlists and songs inside will be saved and written in the form of a list in that file.</p>
<h3>Playlists</h3>
<p>This is the main application functionality, holding a list of songs and ensuring only one is active at a
    time.</p>
<h4>Creating playlists</h4>
<p>To create a new playlist, make sure the proper preset is activated and select "Add new playlist" from the
    application menu at the bottom of the screen.
    <br>
    You will be asked to give a name to the playlist and then be moved to the editing screen.</p>
<p>On this screen, you can add new songs by clicking the "Add new song" button. After that action, a new window will
    open with the default Android file selection. Choose songs which should be added to the playlist and
    confirm your selection.</p>
<p>To remove a song, press and hold it for a bit, which will activate multiple selection. Select all
    songs that you would like to remove and confirm by pressing "Remove selected songs".</p>
<p>Press the back button on your phone or tap the back arrow at the top of the screen.</p>
<h4>Editing playlists</h4>
<p>To edit an existing playlist, choose "Edit playlist" from the context menu available under the three dots on the
    playlist card.</p>
<p>The editing screen is identical to the creation screen and works exactly the same way.</p>
<h4>Changing playlist card appearance</h4>
<p>It's possible to change the unique look of each playlist separately. To change the appearance, select "Change
    playlist look" from the context menu available under the three dots on the playlist card.</p>
<p>On this screen, you can pick and crop a photo or picture from your gallery by clicking the "Change
    background" button.</p>
<p>If you would like to remove the existing background and restore the default playlist card look, select the
    "Remove background" button.</p>
<p>To adjust the text visible on the picture, select one of the available colors by clicking the "Change text color"
    button.
    You can additionally add a shadow outline to improve its readability (enabled by default).</p>
<h4>Removing playlists</h4>
<p>To remove a playlist, select "Delete playlist" from the context menu available under the three dots on the
    playlist card.<br>
    <b>Please note that this operation cannot be undone!</b>
</p>
<p>
    No physical files will be removed during this operation.</p>
<h4>Copying playlists</h4>
<p>It's possible to duplicate your previously created playlist in order to make more similar ones or
    have an exact copy within another preset.</p>
<p>To copy a playlist, select "Copy playlist" from the playlist context menu. This will show a toast message with information that the playlist is now in the application clipboard. Now select another preset
    or stay in the current one and then select "Paste playlist" from the bottom application menu.</p>
<p>This operation will create an exact copy of the playlist, including all song information, background,
    text color, etc. Only the current song and whether the playlist is currently active are not
    carried over. Once this operation is done, the app clipboard will be cleared and the paste option won't
    be available until the next playlist is copied.</p>
<p>Please note that once a playlist is copied and pasted, it's not linked to the original playlist. The new
    playlist is just a duplicate, and changing either of them does not affect the other.</p>
<h4>Changing the order of playlists</h4>
<p>It's possible to change the order of playlists within a preset.<br>To do so, long press on a playlist and
    then drag and drop it to a new place. The new order will be saved right away. Any newly added or pasted
    playlist is always added at the last position.</p>
<h3>Playback</h3>
<p>To start playing your playlist, all you need to do is either click it to activate it or
    press the play button if it's already active. The play button is available at the bottom of the screen
    together with other multimedia buttons.</p>
<p>If for some reason the application cannot play one of the songs (bad format or the file was moved/deleted),
    the application will show a notification, remove the song from that playlist, and attempt to play the next
    song from the playlist.</p>
<h4>Shuffle playlist</h4>
<p>By default, the application will try to play songs in random order from the selected playlist. This will be
    done by temporarily creating a random list of all songs from the playlist and going through it one by
    one. When the list plays the last song, a new one will be randomly created and the current song will be in the
    last position.</p>
<p>The random order is generated every time a playlist is activated, which means that if we switch
    playlists often and the playlist is not big enough, some songs might play more often.</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
The application has some basic settings.
<h4>Dark mode</h4>
<p>How the application should be displayed; light mode by default.</p>
<h4>Fade between songs duration</h4>
<p>How long (in seconds) the transition should be when moving from one song to another or when
    activating another playlist.</p>
<h4>Don't turn off screen</h4>
<p>When selected, the application will prevent the screen from turning off as long as it's active.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If something goes wrong and the application crashes, please create an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>In settings, tap the version number 5 times to enable developer mode. Then you can enable debug logging. This will store some debug information about user interactions with the application.</p>
<p>Whenever the application crashes, log files are generated. Please include those in your issue.</p>
