<h3>Application to play songs in playlists</h3>
<p>Main goal is to create multiple playlists ( grouped within presets) and allow to quickly switch
    between them by single tap<br>
    When playlist is tapped, app will save current song position and fade into new song ( fade time
    can be
    configured )
</p>
<p>Let's imagine you want to organize D&D roleplay session. You can configure couple playlists like
    "tavern", "dungeons" , "woods" "battle" etc. etc. </p>
<p>Add songs based on theme to each of those playlist, and start your session</p>
<p> Your party wentures into woods? You have playlist for this!</p>
<p>They were ambushed by some orcs and battle is
    starting, switch to "battle" and in matters of seconds , your theme music changes.</p>
<p>Once enemy is slain , just tap back to woods playlist and continue with your quest just where you finished...</p>
<h3>How to use?</h3>
<h4>Presets</h4>
<p>After first launch there is nothing there. You have to start by creating a preset.<br>It will be
    one of many collections of playlists, grouped together for various occasions. Thanks to this ,
    you can have
    some peaceful collection for board games with family , and another with some heavy metal for
    rpg session
    with your friends ( or other way around ...) </p>
<p>Once you create and make preset active , new playlist is created will be assigned to it</p>
<p>To switch to new preset , either click your current preset name at the top of application , or
    choose "presets" from application menu at the bottom</p>
