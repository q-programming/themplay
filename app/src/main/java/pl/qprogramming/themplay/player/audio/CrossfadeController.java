/**
 * A controller class that manages smooth audio crossfade transitions between ExoPlayer instances.
 *
 * <p>This class provides audio crossfading capabilities for music playback applications,
 * enabling seamless transitions between tracks through real-time volume manipulation. It operates
 * by gradually decreasing the volume of the current audio stream while simultaneously increasing
 * the volume of the next stream over a specified duration.</p>
 *
 * <p>The controller is designed to work with ExoPlayer instances that have been configured with
 * VolumeScalingAudioProcessor instances, allowing for precise volume control that functions
 * even during screen casting and audio routing scenarios where traditional MediaPlayer volume
 * controls may be ineffective.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Smooth crossfade transitions between two audio streams</li>
 *   <li>Independent fade-in and fade-out operations</li>
 *   <li>Configurable fade duration with high-resolution timing</li>
 *   <li>Automatic resource cleanup and error handling</li>
 *   <li>Thread-safe operation on the main looper</li>
 *   <li>Callback-based completion notification</li>
 *   <li>Graceful handling of invalid states and edge cases</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Uses a Handler with 50ms intervals for smooth volume transitions</li>
 *   <li>Employs linear volume curves for predictable fade behavior</li>
 *   <li>Automatically manages ExoPlayer lifecycle during transitions</li>
 *   <li>Prevents overlapping fade operations through automatic cancellation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * CrossfadeController controller = new CrossfadeController();
 *
 * // Start a crossfade between two players
 * controller.startCrossfade(3000, processorPair, currentPlayer, nextPlayer,
 *     new CrossfadeCallback() {
 *         public void onCrossfadeComplete(ExoPlayer newPlayer, VolumeScalingAudioProcessor processor) {
 *             // Handle successful transition
 *         }
 *         public void onCrossfadeAborted() {
 *             // Handle failed transition
 *         }
 *     });
 * }</pre>
